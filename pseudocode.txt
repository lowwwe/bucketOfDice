Stuff to understand

dice D6 1,2,3,4,5,6
numbers from number of faces down to 1 in steps of one
all numbers will be whole numbers.
rand() will return random number from 0 -> 32,000(ish)
srand(seed) will start the random sequence at a particular point.
time(0) will return the number of miliseconds since 1970 (ish)
any number mod 6 will results in one of the following 0,1,2,3,4,5
If we add 1 to these we get the numbers on a D6
std::cout << "output"
std::cin >> input






Pseudo code
int dieFaces

srand(now)
output "How many faces on your Dice ?"
input dieFaces
rollDice(dieFaces);
rollDice(dieFaces);
...

rollDice(dieFaces);

rollDice( int dieFaces)
{
	int result
	result = rand() % dieFaces +1
	output "you rolled a " & result
}
